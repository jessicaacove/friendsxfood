# foodfriends

This was my second project as part of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. 
I had five days to create an application using Node.js, Express, and Mongodb. 

Food friends capitalizes on the opportunity to form a friendship based on a shared interest in food, 
by paring users who would like to visit the same restaurant. 

I plan to improve the user's view of their "pairing" by using ajax to automatically update the page
when a match is made.
